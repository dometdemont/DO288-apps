Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that\n                      is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object.\n                      If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints\n                      are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. \"NodePort\"\n                      builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes\n                      to the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates\n                      an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)\n                      which routes to the clusterIP.

Example: when this\n                          is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70%\n                          of desired pods immediately when the rolling update starts.\n                          Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled down\n                          further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring\n                          that the total number of pods available at all times during\n                          the update is at least 70% of desired pods.'\n                    type: object\n                  updateType:\n                    type: string\n                required:\n                - updateType\n                type: object\n              upfPrometheusCollector:\n                description: UPF Prometheus Collector for UPF NF only and has been added\n                  till UPF is ready to be brought into the cluster\n                type: boolean\n            type: object\n          status:\n            description: AxyomNSSFStatus defines the observed state of AxyomNSSF\n            properties:\n              conditions:\n                items:\n                  properties:\n                    status:\n                      type: string\n                    type:\n                      type: string\n                  required:\n                  - status\n                  - type\n                  type: object\n                type: array\n              state:\n                enum:\n                - Initializing\n                - Running\n                - Configuring\n                - Pending\n                type: string\n              svcstatus:\n                additionalProperties:\n                  description: AxyomServiceStatus defines the observed state of AxyomService\n                  properties:\n                    clusterIP:\n                      type: string\n                    phase:\n                      type: string\n                    podCount:\n                      format: int32\n                      type: integer\n                    podState:\n                      additionalProperties:\n                        properties:\n                          status:\n                            type: string\n                        type: object\n                      type: object\n                    retryCount:\n                      format: int32\n                      type: integer\n                  type: object\n                type: object\n            required:\n            - state\n            type: object\n        type: object\n    version: v1alpha1\n    versions:\n    - name: v1alpha1\n      served: true\n      storage: true\n  status:\n    acceptedNames:\n      kind: \"\"\n      plural: \"\"\n    conditions: []\n    storedVersions: []\n- apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1\n  kind: CustomResourceDefinition\n  metadata:\n    annotations:\n      controller-gen.kubebuilder.io/version: v0.2.2\n    creationTimestamp: null\n    name: axyompgws.axyom.casa.io\n  spec:\n    additionalPrinterColumns:\n    - JSONPath: .status.state\n      name: Status\n      type: string\n    - JSONPath: .metadata.creationTimestamp\n      name: Age\n      type: date\n    group: axyom.casa.io\n    names:\n      categories:\n      - nfs\n      kind: AxyomPGW\n      listKind: AxyomPGWList\n      plural: axyompgws\n      singular: axyompgw\n    scope: Namespaced\n    subresources:\n      status: {}\n    validation:\n      openAPIV3Schema:\n        description: AxyomPGW is the Schema for the axyompgws API\n        properties:\n          apiVersion:\n            description: 'APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation\n              of an object.

Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that\n                      is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object.\n                      If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints\n                      are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. \"NodePort\"\n                      builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes\n                      to the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates\n                      an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)\n                      which routes to the clusterIP.
